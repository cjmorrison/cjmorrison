I’m C.J. Morrison (he/him) LMS Technologist / Developer

If you have come here to view my work, there will not be much because NDA's and me not having a lot of spare time.

I've been primarily developing tools for Learning Managements Systems (LMS) like Brightspace for nearly a decade. I also specilize in educational interactives, games, simuations. 
This (lately) is me cramming API's into a react app so that non-coders can interface with data. This involves a lot of planning, user empathy and knowledge of many different standards.

I am available for contracts and consultations, reach me at cj@cjmorrison.com for details or a resume.
